# This program is made to determine the distance traveled by a car



SPEED = 70
distancet6 = SPEED * 6
distancet10 = SPEED * 10 
distancet15 = SPEED * 15

# To set the tone up for the answers
print ("How many miles will a car travel if they travel X amount of hours?")

# A simple output of how many miles the car will travel
print ('The miles a car has traveled for 6 hours is', distancet6)
print ('The miles a car has traveled for 10 hours is', distancet10)
print ('The miles a car has traveled for 15 hours is', distancet15)
